I designed and printed a soap dispenser so that a local small business didn't need to hold a funnel for over 8 minutes a bottle! That's a big saving of time.

## Process

1. I first made a cardboard prototype, which was very loose and messy. Made with cardboard cut to shape and selotape. There's a picture of this at the bottom of the page.
2. I then measured the dimensions of this prototype and modelled a rough skeleton in CAD.
3. I then tidied the CAD model up, ensured I measured the bottle for the holder so that it fit.
4. I printed this overnight, it took 18 hours at 0.2mm 35% infill.
5. Test!
