DIY 3D-Printed Sanding Stick Organizer: A Creative Workspace Solution

As a DIY enthusiast and someone who enjoys working with various materials, I've come to realize the importance of maintaining a well-organized workspace. One particular challenge I faced was keeping my sanding sticks and tools easily accessible. In this blog post, I'm excited to share a simple project that perfectly blends creativity and practicality: crafting my own 3D-printed sanding stick holder. Armed with just a few tools and access to a 3D printer, I embarked on creating a personalized solution to neatly organize my essential sanding tools.

### Materials Used:

- 3D Printer and filament
- Computer with 3D modeling software (e.g., Tinkercad, Fusion 360)
- [Sanding sticks](https://amzn.eu/d/isVvJ08)
- Ruler or calipers

### Step 1: Designing My Holder

The initial step in this creative journey was designing my sanding stick holder using 3D modeling software. Starting with a straightforward design, I measured the length and diameter of my sanding sticks using a ruler, ensuring the slots I designed would securely hold them. I created a stable base and incorporated slots tailored to the specific dimensions of my sanding sticks.

It was key that the doors were hinged so that I could easily access the sanding sticks, but quickly close it up for storage. Ensuring practicality, I incorporated a step in the design to prevent the doors from accidentally closing into the slots when not in use.

### Step 2: Ironing!

Ok well 3D printing, but with the Ironing setting.

The ironing feature can be a game-changer when aiming for a smoother and more polished finish, although I hadn't realised quite how much. I experimented with this feature on the holder, turning it on for the second set of door prints, grits 120-320. 

The ironing feature essentially smooths the top layer of a print, enhancing its surface quality. As I examined the doors side by side, the difference was striking. The doors with the ironing feature displayed a noticeably sleeker surface, showcasing a level of refinement that was absent in the untreated counterparts. This simple yet effective technique not only contributes to a more professional appearance but also demonstrates the versatility of 3D printing in achieving precision and aesthetic appeal in DIY projects.

I was going to re-print the first doors, but I love the fact that I can keep the difference as a visual reminder for future projects.


### Step 3: Organising my Workspace
With the 3D-printed sanding stick holder in hand, I joyfully organized my workspace. Sliding each sanding stick into its designated slot, I marveled at the convenience of having my tools easily accessible, making my DIY projects more efficient and enjoyable.

Ok that's clearly an exageration but it's definitly a clean storage option.

### Step 4: The secret sauce

As a finishing touch to my 3D-printed sanding stick holder, I couldn't resist incorporating a dash of personal flair. With a nod to my previous blog post on the importance of a maker's mark, I cheekily added my signature emblem to the back of the holder. This subtle detail not only serves as a reminder of the pride I take in my creations but also adds a touch of personality to the functional design. Now, as I reach for my sanding sticks with doors elegantly ironed, the subtle presence of my maker's mark adds a wink of creativity to the overall craftsmanship. After all, every DIY project deserves its own unique stamp!
